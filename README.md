# dotfiles
These are my personal configuration files. They are a continual work in progress and recently reset to be heavily based on [Thorsten Ball's dotfiles](https://github.com/mrnugget/dotfiles/).

## Usage
All files are edited within the repo, then symlinks are created to them using the Makefile.

- Run one symlink/setup. ZSH for example: `make zsh`
- Run all symlinks/setup: `make all`

## Look into these ideas
- [tmux sessionizer](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer)
- runs folder
- learn more bash

## Tools Configured 
- FZF: look into how this works
- ZSH
- Ghostty
- Zoxide
- Tmux
